#Life of Fred

Life of Fred is a unique artificial life game for iOS and Android. In this game the player follows and interacts with the main character Fred, as Fred's live unfolds.

##Objective

Life of Fred has no objective. The player watches Fred grow up and enjoy life.

##Style

Life of Fred has a retro look. The game has a unique pixelated style with a front view style design. It is reminiscent of great games like Little Computer People and The Sims.

##Fred

Fred is a nice little pixel guy. When you first meet Fred, Fred is 20 years old. He has finished his education. Sadly, both his parents are already dead. He lives in the house that he inherited from them. It is a big house. Frankly, a little too big for Fred alone. Fred is a friendly guy, but he likes his peace and quiet.
